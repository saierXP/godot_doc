msgid "The PointMesh is made from a single point. Instead of relying on triangles, points are rendered as a single rectangle on the screen with a constant size. They are intended to be used with Particle systems, but can be used as a cheap way to render constant size billboarded sprites (for example in a point cloud)."

Point size can be accessed in a shader with ``POINT_SIZE``, or in a :ref:`SpatialMaterial<class_SpatialMaterial>` by setting :ref:`SpatialMaterial.flags_use_point_size<class_SpatialMaterial_property_flags_use_point_size>` and the variable :ref:`SpatialMaterial.params_point_size<class_SpatialMaterial_property_params_point_size>`."
