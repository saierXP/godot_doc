msgid "An infinite plane shape for 3D collisions. Note that the :ref:`Plane<class_Plane>`'s normal matters; anything \"below\" the plane will collide with it. If the ``PlaneShape`` is used in a :ref:`PhysicsBody<class_PhysicsBody>`, it will cause colliding objects placed \"below\" it to teleport \"above\" the plane."
