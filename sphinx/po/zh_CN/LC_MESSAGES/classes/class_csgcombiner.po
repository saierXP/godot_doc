"For complex arrangements of shapes, it is sometimes needed to add structure "
"to your CSG nodes. The CSGCombiner node allows you to create this structure. "
"The node encapsulates the result of the CSG operations of its children. In "
"this way, it is possible to do operations on one set of shapes that are "
"children of one CSGCombiner node, and a set of separate operations on a "
"second set of shapes that are children of a second CSGCombiner node, and "
"then do an operation that takes the two end results as its input to create "
"the final shape."
