"This is a helper spatial node for our camera; note that, if stereoscopic "
"rendering is applicable (VR-HMD), most of the camera properties are ignored, "
"as the HMD information overrides them. The only properties that can be "
"trusted are the near and far planes."

"The position and orientation of this node is automatically updated by the "
"ARVR Server to represent the location of the HMD if such tracking is "
"available and can thus be used by game logic. Note that, in contrast to the "
"ARVR Controller, the render thread has access to the most up-to-date "
"tracking data of the HMD and the location of the ARVRCamera can lag a few "
"milliseconds behind what is used for rendering as a result."
