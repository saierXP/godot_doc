"This node implements all the physics logic needed to simulate a car. It is "
"based on the raycast vehicle system commonly found in physics engines. You "
"will need to add a :ref:`CollisionShape<class_CollisionShape>` for the main "
"body of your vehicle and add :ref:`VehicleWheel<class_VehicleWheel>` nodes "
"for the wheels. You should also add a :ref:"
"`MeshInstance<class_MeshInstance>` to this node for the 3D model of your car "
"but this model should not include meshes for the wheels. You should control "
"the vehicle by using the :ref:`brake<class_VehicleBody_property_brake>`, :"
"ref:`engine_force<class_VehicleBody_property_engine_force>`, and :ref:"
"`steering<class_VehicleBody_property_steering>` properties and not change "
"the position or orientation of this node directly."
