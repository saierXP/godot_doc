"The ``ARVRAnchor`` point is a spatial node that maps a real world location "
"identified by the AR platform to a position within the game world. For "
"example, as long as plane detection in ARKit is on, ARKit will identify and "
"update the position of planes (tables, floors, etc) and create anchors for "
"them."

"This node is mapped to one of the anchors through its unique ID. When you "
"receive a signal that a new anchor is available, you should add this node to "
"your scene for that anchor. You can predefine nodes and set the ID; the "
"nodes will simply remain on 0,0,0 until a plane is recognized."

"Keep in mind that, as long as plane detection is enabled, the size, placing "
"and orientation of an anchor will be updated as the detection logic learns "
"more about the real world out there especially if only part of the surface "
"is in view."
